Through The Window
==================

When you rode in a backseat of a car as a kid, and looked through the window, did you picture
a running man, jumping over obstacles along the road? No? Well, I did. This is what Through The
Window is about: helping the small guy not smash into stuff that the car passes.

You'll need SDL2 installed, as well as Perl 6 and the NativeCalll module for it.
Then, run 'perl6 Configure.pl', 'make' and './ThroughTheWindow',
that should work :)

This game features a manual soundtrack. Copyright laws probably forbid me from bundling it
with the game, so before you start playing, please go to
